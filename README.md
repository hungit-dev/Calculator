# Calculator

-This project took me a while to figure out the logic of it. Because of that, I spent approximately 1 week for this project. The funny part is that thinking about logic took me more than half of the week, and I actually just dedicated 1-1.5 days to writing code, which is less than i had imagined
-In order to finish this project. First, I created a sketch about dividing large chunk of information into smaller parts. And then I tried to solve each smaller thing. Once all of them were solved, I linked them together into one final product
-I even got to know more about tips for improving function syntax and practical/concrete applications of it. Got better in js but forget most of css syntax lol
